 #  solving 2D trusses by Stiffness method using matlab m file
 
 It is a simple script that can solve trusses that have any number of (joints-members-forces-supports).
 Produce output of (Reactions â€“ Internal forces).
 the input and the output in numerical form.
 
 ### Note: 
 this script was written as part of the graduation project.  
   
 ### Assumptions :

 - E = constant .
 - A = constant for all members
 - input supports after free nodes (arange nodes according its degree of freedom )
 - joint can have any number of Load 
 - angle (Degree ) ,other parameters uniteless
 - no settelment consideration
